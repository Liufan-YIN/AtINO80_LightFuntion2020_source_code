Note: the bioinformatics scripts conclude shell and R scripts which are given in directories named “shell_scripts”and “R_scripts” respectively. R custom functions used in R scripts are listed in directory named “R_functions”. Please source the related funcitons befor perform R script. In this text, shell scripts, R scripts, R custom functions and figure names are marked by green, orange, blue and red color respectively to facilitate understanding. In addition to, the provided scripts here may require additional steps and modifications to perform well on different platforms.
